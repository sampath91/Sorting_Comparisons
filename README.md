# Sortings Comparison
Implemented Comparison-based sorting algorithms and observed their performance for different data sets.<br/>

These algorithms are implemented in Python 2.7<br/>

Following are the sorting algorithms implemented and compared:

1. Heap sort<br/>
2. Merge sort<br/>
3. In-place quicksort (any random item or the first or the last item of your input can be pivot).<br/>
4. Modified quicksort<br/>
	a. Use median-of-three as pivot.<br/>
	b. For small subproblem size ( ), you must use insertion sort.<br/>
	
In cmd, run “python Project.py”. Following results are displayed in order below:<br/>
1.‘Heap sort’, ‘merge sort’, ‘quick sort’ and ‘quicksort with median of three and insertion sort’ for unsorted input<br/>
2.‘Heap sort’, ‘merge sort’, ‘quicksort with median of three and insertion sort’  and ‘quick sort’  for sorted input in ascending order<br/>
3.‘Heap sort’, ‘merge sort’, ‘quicksort with median of three and insertion sort’  and ‘quick sort’  for sorted input in descending order<br/>
