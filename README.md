# Sortings Comparison
Implemented Comparison-based sorting algorithms and observed their performance for different data sets.

These algorithms are implemented in Python 2.7

Following are the sorting algorithms implemented and compared:

1. Heap sort
2. Merge sort
3. In-place quicksort (any random item or the first or the last item of your input can be pivot).
4. Modified quicksort
	a. Use median-of-three as pivot.
	b. For small subproblem size ( ), you must use insertion sort.
	
In cmd, run “python Project.py”. Following results are displayed in order below:
1.‘Heap sort’, ‘merge sort’, ‘quick sort’ and ‘quicksort with median of three and insertion sort’ for unsorted input
2.‘Heap sort’, ‘merge sort’, ‘quicksort with median of three and insertion sort’  and ‘quick sort’  for sorted input in ascending order
3.‘Heap sort’, ‘merge sort’, ‘quicksort with median of three and insertion sort’  and ‘quick sort’  for sorted input in descending order
